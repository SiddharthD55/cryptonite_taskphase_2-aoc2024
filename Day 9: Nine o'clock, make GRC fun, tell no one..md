## What is Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)?

Before diving into the risk assessment, it’s important to understand the role of **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**. GRC is a framework that helps organizations ensure their security practices align with both internal objectives and external regulatory requirements. Here's how it breaks down:

- **Governance** sets the framework and policies for security decision-making within an organization.
- **Risk** involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, and assessing the likelihood and impact of their occurrence.
- **Compliance** ensures the organization adheres to legal, regulatory, and industry standards, such as GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.

For McSkidy and Glitch, applying GRC principles will help them evaluate potential eDiscovery companies based on their ability to meet security standards, reduce risks, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

## The Importance of Risk Assessments

A **Risk Assessment** is a critical step in identifying potential risks and mitigating them before they cause any damage. By assessing the risks posed by each eDiscovery company, McSkidy and Glitch can determine which company is the safest option.

### Why Do Risk Assessments Matter?

Risk assessments help businesses:

- **Protect data:** Identify potential vulnerabilities in systems and processes before they lead to data breaches.
- **Minimize business risk:** Address security concerns that could impact revenue, reputation, or customer trust.
- **Ensure compliance:** Meet regulatory standards and avoid legal penalties.

In the context of McSkidy and Glitch, conducting a risk assessment will allow them to select the company with the best security practices, ensuring the investigation stays on track.

## Steps in Performing the Risk Assessment

### Step 1: Identify Potential Risks

The first step is to identify any risks that might affect the investigation if McSkidy and Glitch choose a particular eDiscovery company. Some potential risks to look out for include:

- **Unpatched systems:** Third-party vendors using outdated software could be vulnerable to cyberattacks.
- **Inadequate security protocols:** A company with poor security practices might be a target for hackers.
- **Non-compliance with regulations:** Companies that don’t meet industry standards or regulatory requirements could expose McSkidy and Glitch to legal risks.
- **Vendor vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses within a third-party vendor’s security could lead to a breach or data loss.

### Step 2: Assess Likelihood of Each Risk

Once the risks are identified, the next step is to assess how likely these risks are to occur. I typically use a scale from **1 to 5** to measure likelihood:

- **1 (Improbable):** Very unlikely to happen.
- **2 (Remote):** Unlikely, but still possible.
- **3 (Occasional):** Likely to happen at some point.
- **4 (Probable):** Likely to occur several times.
- **5 (Frequent):** Highly likely to happen regularly.

For example, a company with outdated software might have a **3** (Occasional) likelihood of a breach, whereas a company with robust security measures might have a **1** (Improbable) likelihood.

### Step 3: Assess Impact

Next, I’ll assess the **impact** of each risk if it were to materialize. The impact score is also on a **1 to 5 scale**, where:

- **1 (Informational):** Minimal impact, no significant damage.
- **2 (Low):** Limited impact on one area of operations, little to no revenue loss.
- **3 (Medium):** Major impact on one part of operations, causing some revenue loss.
- **4 (High):** Significant impact on several areas of operations, leading to substantial revenue loss.
- **5 (Critical):** An existential threat to the business.

For instance, if a data breach occurs, it could have a **4** (High) impact on McSkidy and Glitch’s reputation, causing significant business disruptions.

### Step 4: Calculate Risk Score

I calculate the **Risk Score** by multiplying the **Likelihood** and **Impact** scores. A higher score indicates a higher level of risk.

For example, if a company’s risk is rated as **Likelihood: 3 (Occasional)** and **Impact: 4 (High)**, the total risk score would be **12** (3 x 4). This helps prioritize which risks need to be mitigated first.

## Third-Party Risk Assessments

Risk assessments aren’t just done internally within McSkidy and Glitch; they also need to assess the risks posed by third-party vendors. Since McSkidy and Glitch are choosing an eDiscovery company to handle sensitive data, they must evaluate the security practices of the potential vendors.

### What to Evaluate in Third-Party Risk Assessments

I will evaluate the following aspects for each eDiscovery company:

- **Security measures:** Does the company use encryption, access controls, and other best practices to protect data?
- **Compliance with regulations:** Is the company compliant with data protection laws like GDPR or industry standards like ISO 27001?
- **Incident history:** Has the company experienced data breaches or security incidents in the past? Do they have a clear incident response plan in place?
- **Vendor management:** Does the eDiscovery company evaluate the security practices of its own suppliers and partners?

By evaluating these factors, McSkidy and Glitch can ensure that the eDiscovery company they choose is capable of keeping forensic data safe and maintaining business continuity.

## Basically...

By following this structured risk assessment process, McSkidy and Glitch will be able to assess which eDiscovery company is the safest option for handling their forensic data. They will identify risks, quantify them, and prioritize actions to mitigate potential threats. Ultimately, this will help them select a vendor that aligns with their security standards and protects their business from unnecessary risks.

This process ensures that they make an informed decision, safeguarding the investigation while reducing the potential for data breaches, regulatory violations, or any other issues that could derail the investigation.
